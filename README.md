# Control Theory Exercises

This repository contains a few Python scripts exploring basic concepts in control theory. The code is written out of personal curiosity and interest in understanding the fundamentals of control systems.

There are four Python files, each tackling different theoretical aspects or examples from control theory, such as system response, stability, and feedback.

Feel free to explore or use as a starting point for your own learning.
